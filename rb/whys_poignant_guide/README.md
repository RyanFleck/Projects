# Why's Poignant Guide (wGtR)

*Oh, neat!* You've stumbled upon my notes on *Why the Lucky Stiff's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby.* It's free to read online [here](https://poignant.guide).

I've split my notes/functions into chapters for now, but they may get broken down into chapter-section in the future. To get started with ruby, I've installed `rbenv` and Ruby 2.6.3.
