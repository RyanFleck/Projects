Capo 2

[Intro]

Em   Em   Bm7  Bm7

[Verse 1]

Em
Someday soon, I don't know when, your little world
Will come crashing in, don't think twice, I’ll be around
Turn your back
                        Bm                       Em
Someone's gonna let you down, you know that it's true

       Bm                            A
Nobody led you on, they left that to you

               C                       G
Now you'll be alone when the sun comes up

                          C                   G
With your tattered little dreams and a broken cup

                    C         G
Then you'll have to trust yourself

    A                C       Em
And don't believe in anymore lies

[Verse 2]

    Em
You waste your time, think too much, really make a mess
of the things you touch, poor little bird with a broken wing
better look around now
                            Bm                 Em
You know you're losing everything, it's just a game

                   Bm                              A
Thought you had it all lined up but somehow that's changed

                   C               G
Now you'll have to run and not get caught

                   C                      G
Now you'll have to hide if you like it or not

                    C         G
Then you'll have to trust yourself

    A                C       Em
And don't believe in anymore lies

[Verse 3]

Em
Someday soon, it won't be long, you’ll ring a bell
But they'll all be gone, they took your jewels and your statues too
Left you with a pile of things

                         Bm                 Em
You never learned how to use here it comes again

                       Bm                               A
You showed us where it all began well here's where it ends

               C                       G
Now you'll be alone when the sun comes up

                          C                   G
With your tattered little dreams and a broken cup

                    C         G
Then you'll have to trust yourself

    A                C
And don't believe in anymore 

          G
Trust yourself

    A                C
And don't believe in anymore

          G
Trust yourself

    A                C       Em
And don't believe in anymore lies

yeah yeah yeah...
