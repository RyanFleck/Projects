    "# Random Experiments Completed While Reading Lutz - Learning Python\n",
    "Mark Lutz's book, *Learning Python*, published by O'Reilly in 2013, describes the bulk of Python 2 and 3. Though a bit dated, I'm going to run through and run all of my *'oh, is that how that works?'* programs here. The most interesting learn-ings will probably be rolled into a collection of articles basically announcing *'oh wow, here's this neat thing, did you know this?'* I'll have a lot of fun writing and publishing those."
