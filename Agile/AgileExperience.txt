Dear Employer,

I don't have any true agile experience, since I haven't had a job in the industry. However, professors Hal Osman and Miguel Garzon both lectured on the merits of agile development methods and outlined how they worked.

I'm sure that, having learned how agile development works, I would be comfortable being placed in an environment that used agile to develop software.
