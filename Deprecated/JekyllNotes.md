# Ryan's Jekyll Reference

## Installation:
1. Install make, gcc, g++ and ruby-dev with apt.
2. Install bundler and jekyll with gem.

If you have horrible problems getting bundler to run:

```
Upgrading rubygems installed bundler in /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems, but the wrapper script seems to expect to find it in /usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.1/exe/

Downgrading to rubygems 2.7.4 via gem update --system 2.7.4 seems to fix the problem.
```
