####Application Guidelines:
The CookHelper application selects and displays recipes that contain the ingredients you have.
With this type of tool you can:
+ Add, edit or delete recipes
+ Search for recipes based on ingredients AND the category of the recipe (Main dish,
starter, dessert appetizer, drink, sauce) OR the type of food (Italian, Greek, Chinese,
Colombian, etc)
+ Search queries must be done using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT).
Example: Tomato AND onion AND avocado
+ Obtain results according to relevance (e.g. 3/5 ingredients found in recipe).
+ Access a comprehensive set of easy to follow instructions.
