RCF - Guide to SSH keys.

To generate a key:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@email.com"
	> Save this in the default location.	

To add the key to your ssh service:
	eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"	> Starts the SSH service.
	ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa	> Adds the key.

To add the key to the github account:
	> Use the website, lol. Add the .pub key.
	> On your computer, set:
	git config --global user.name "First Last"
	git config --global user.email "email@email.com"
	git config --global core.editor "vim"

	> Now you can add repos, like so:
	git clone ssh://git@github.com/RyanFleck/School.git
	git clone ssh://git@github.com/RyanFleck/Projects.git

	> As long as you have access to the repo they will clone properly.
	> You no longer have to enter a username and password to push/pull.
