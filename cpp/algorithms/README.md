# CPP Project Boilerplate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RyanFleck/CPP-Project-Boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RyanFleck/CPP-Project-Boilerplate)

Basic C++ boilerplate with CI. Will be adding unit testing (just as soon as I learn it!)

As per the *Competitive Programmer's Handbook*, the `.cpp` are compiled with the C++11 standard `-std=c++11`, the code is optimized `-O2`, and all warnings are printed `-Wall`.
