 * C++ Algorithms: Multiples

 * Finds the common multiples of two numbers below a third number.
 *
 * All algorithms are currently compiled and tested in algo_main.cpp,
 * as I learn more C++ the running/testing system will allow test runs
 * of single algorithms by name. Currently test runs are seperated as
 * functions within algo_main.cpp, and need to be enabled/disabled.
