  "poem":"From childhood's hour I have not been\nAs others were; I have not seen\nAs others saw; I could not bring\nMy passions from a common spring.\nFrom the same source I have not taken\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\nThen- in my childhood, in the dawn\nOf a most stormy life- was drawn\nFrom every depth of good and ill\nThe mystery which binds me still:\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\nFrom the lightning in the sky\nAs it passed me flying by,\nFrom the thunder and the storm,\nAnd the cloud that took the form\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\nOf a demon in my view."
