Answers to questions:

A. Using a sorted list, the second best method, could be marked to allow the algorithm to search after a certain point, but this method could still run at n^2.
B. Using an unsorted list, the worst method, the worst-case scenario will occur when the program needs to search through an entire list to find an element. This has a runtime of n^2.
C. Using a heap, the best method, the runtime will be nlogn, as the algorithm will have to perform an exponentially lower number of operaitons in order to find an element.
