Creating graph
Initializing Kruskal Algorithms
Next it will group vertices in 3 clusters.
before Kruskal Algorithm
after Kruskal Algorithm

Data was clustered as follows
Cluster 1 (size=11): v7:Buffalo,v6:Sheep,v9:Fox,v8:Guinea Pig,v10:Pig,v2:Mule,v1:Donkey,v0:Horse,v3:Camel,v4:Llama,v5:Zebra,
Cluster 2 (size=2): v11:Rabbit,v12:Rat,
Cluster 3 (size=3): v15:Whale,v13:Deer,v14:Reindeer,
