#  The reading and arithmetic scores for fourth and sixth grades were
#  tabulated.  The score represents the measured level, in years of
#  school.  Thus a reading level of 4.6 records someone somewhere
#  between the level of a 4th and 4th grader.
#
#  School is the name of the school.
#
#  "4R" and "4A" are the reading and arithmetic scores for the fourth grade.
#
#  "6R" and "6A" are the reading and arithmetic scores for the sixth grade.
