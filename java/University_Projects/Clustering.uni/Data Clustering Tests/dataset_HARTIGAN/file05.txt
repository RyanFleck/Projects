#  A jigsaw puzzle comprises 20 pieces, arranged in a regular array
#  and numbered as follows:
#
#     1   2   3   4
#     5   6   7   8
#     9  10  11  12
#    13  14  15  16
#    17  18  19  20
#
#  Each piece is roughly rectangular.  The corners of the piece are called
#  its vertices, and the sides are called its edges.  The four edges of 
#  each piece are numbered consecutively, starting from the top and 
#  moving clockwise.
#
#  For each piece, three measurements were made on each of the four edges,
#  estimating the length of the side, and the amount by which the edge
#  cuts into or juts out of the line joining the two vertices on that side.
#  The measurements are in hundredths of an inch.
#
#  # is the number of the piece.
#
#  L1 is length of the line between the corners.
#  I1 is the maximum deviation of the line into the piece
#  O1 is the maximum deviation of the line out of the piece.
#
#  L2 is length of the line between the corners.
#  I2 is the maximum deviation of the line into the piece
#  O2 is the maximum deviation of the line out of the piece.
#
#  L3 is length of the line between the corners.
#  I3 is the maximum deviation of the line into the piece
#  O3 is the maximum deviation of the line out of the piece.
#
#  L4 is length of the line between the corners.
#  I4 is the maximum deviation of the line into the piece
#  O4 is the maximum deviation of the line out of the piece.
