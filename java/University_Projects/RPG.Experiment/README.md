This RPG experiment guides the player through a binary tree of rooms to fight monsters, and records their journey to a text file.

The story that is generated can thereafter be read like a short story. The primary goal of this project was to make the output exciting and readable.

Still to be implemented:
-Monsters.
-Combat system.
-Item system.
