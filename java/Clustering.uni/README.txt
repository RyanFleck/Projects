CSI2110A Assignment 4
By Ryan Fleck 8276723

No major notes. The Partition class was especially fun to tinker with.

I cleaned a lot of my print statements up initially, but then I saw the note at the bottom of the assignment. As a result, I ended up leaving most of them in, to show how thoroughly I attempted to test the files.

Something neat that I built was a printout that really helped me.
It pointed out the clusters before and after a deleted cluster.
Really helped me troubleshoot. You can see it below and in the testfiles for the relevant part.

EX:

DNODE7: G
DNODE8: H <START DELETION
DNODE9: J <END DELETION
DNODE10: K


I did attempt to use the Data Clustering Tests, but didn't get very far.

Thanks,

R
