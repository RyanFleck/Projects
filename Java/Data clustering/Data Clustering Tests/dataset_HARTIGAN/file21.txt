#  Six pieces of hardware were considered.
#  Every possible set of three distinct pieces of hardware was examined,
#  and a judgment was made about which two pieces were most similar.
#  The results were reported by listing the closest pair with parentheses
#  surrounding them, followed by the "odd" item.
#
#  "N" is nail, "P" Phillips head screw, "B" bolt, "T" tack, "F" finishing
#  nail, and "S" is screw.
