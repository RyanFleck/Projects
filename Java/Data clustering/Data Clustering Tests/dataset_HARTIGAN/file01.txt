#  Some minor planets may have been sighted more than once.  In the
#  table, sightings thought to be of the same planet are listed 
#  together.
#
#  Name is the year of sighting and the initials of the astronomer.
#
#  Node is the angle, in the earth's plane of orbit, at which the
#  minor planet crosses the earth's orbit.
#
#  Inclination is the angle between the orbits of the earth and
#  the minor planet.
#
#  Axis is the maximum distance between the minor planet and the
#  sun, divided by the corresponding quantity for the earth.
