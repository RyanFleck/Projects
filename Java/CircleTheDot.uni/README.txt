This game is basically about trapping the blue dot by the help of the yellow dots. The player has to click on the available grey dots and try to entrap the escaping blue dot. If the blue dot escapes, then the player fails the game. Additionally, we had to implement two more buttons, the undo and redo buttons. Undo button gives the player an option to move back to the previous state and the redo allows the player move back to the original position after the use of undo button. For the bonus, we had to implement, the save option which allows the player to continue from where they left off.
