A note on why the rom isn't here:

1- I couldn't find it. I wipe my OS often, and apparently it wasn't worth preserving.
2- It would have been ~400mb anyways.
3- I can outline what I changed in this file:

Essentially, the ROM was a modified version of the AOSP ROM.

I followed some guides to make it compatible with all of the components of a nexus 5.

The only other modifications I made were:
-Undervolting and underclocking to save power.
-Used Tasker to run scripts every 30 seconds.
-Themed the rom.
