# Ryan's LaTeX Manual


> LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech» (to rhyme with «blech» or «Bertolt Brecht»), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing. [latex-project.org](https://www.latex-project.org/about/)

## Unreasonable amounts of polish for student docs.
