% Wow! You've found the source code for my resume.
% That's pretty neat. To actually compile this,
% You'll need latex and the texlive-latex-extra
% packages installed on your machine. I'm not
% quite sure how to use LaTeX package managers 
% myself, but if you're reading this, you might
% not either. Cheers!
