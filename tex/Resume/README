This directory contains the bbding fontset to be used under LaTeX.  

The original metafont source is written by Karel Horak, which is supposed to have
the copyright for the fonts.  The LaTeX package is written by Peter Møller
Neergaard, which have made some minor changes to the metafont source.
Therefore both the original source and the modified source can be found in
this directory.

The directory contains the following files
	README		This file
	bbding.ins	The installation driver for the LaTeX package
	bbding.dtx	The source for the LaTeX code
	bbding10.mf	The metafont source for the bbding font set with
