# GACP stands for 'git add, commit, push', great for when you're
#   working on a solo project and have everything to commit up in
#   your working state. Not recommended for use in collaborative
#   situations, or when large changes have been made.
# Usage:
#   $ gacp "Upload new materials."
#   ( git output shows here, showing changed files. )
