Ultra simple scripts to write:
gacp - git add-commit-push - takes commit message as only argument.
rtouch - takes -l lang as an option and initializes a file with boilerplate and RCF-timestamp.
clrs - clears display and lists basic directory info. Saves a tiny bit of time.

New standards to propogate:
RCF-Timestamp: 00 00 00 0000
               Y  M  D  H M
