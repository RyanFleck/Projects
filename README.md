Folders are named according to the common file extension of each language for automated CI and personal website integrations.

Every language has a dedicated "Manual", a set of useful personal notes, developed in a different repo and migrated here with a shell script. A full list of manuals is available [here.](https://ryanfleck.github.io/manuals/)

**\*** Code not licensed under the **GPL v3** is noted in the README and in the header of each file, and usually **MIT** licensed. 

## Cloning Instructions

Most repositories have additional dependencies that must be satisfied before running the experiments. Multi-OS functionality has usually been taken into account. These binaries have been discluded to fulfill *GPL* requirements. Notably:
1. To run selenium experiments in `py/`, **chromedriver** and **geckodriver** executables will need to be downloaded and placed in `py/webdrivers`.
