# RCF - Personal Projects

Folders are named according to the common file extension of each language for automation's sake.

Things to note:
- The **sh** folder contains a ton of GNU/Linux resources as well that compliment the shell scripts.
- Every lang/tech has a "Manual", a set of useful personal notes, developed in a different repo and migrated here with a shell script. **RCF-LAB-BOT** may do this periodically. A full list of manuals is available [*here.*](https://ryanfleck.github.io/tutorials)
